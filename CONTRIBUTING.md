# Contributing

Thanks for wanting to improve this project! Instead of opening pull requests, please share a prompt describing:

- What you want the server or tools to do
- What SimVars or behaviors matter
- Any expected outputs or checks

I will run the prompt myself. This keeps changes aligned with real-world usage and intent. If you have logs or screenshots that clarify the request, feel free to include them.+
